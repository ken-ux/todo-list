# todo-list

This is a to-do list app that allows the user to create new tasks and lists, delete tasks, or cross them out. Data persistence is implemented using the Web Storage API. This is an exercise as part of The Odin Project to demonstrate usage of ES6 modules and webpack.

Note: This is rudimentary and a work-in-progress. It currently does not include features such as editing task fields or list deletion. I'll be revisiting this at a later time to optimize the code base and add necessary features.
